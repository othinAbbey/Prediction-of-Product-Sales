# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
## Introduction
### Project details
This Project will give an insight on the insurance charges based on conditions , 
the Conditions are age, region , sex  and smoker or non-smoker. The project will as well consider the bmi to make more accurate estimations on the charges .

# Data Visulaisations
## Histograms showing the distribution of the numerical variables of the insurance data

##  A histogram Showing the Charges

### The histogram shows the count of the charges , we see that the count (10-15000) have the highest counts

##  A Histogram showing the age counts

 ### The histogram shows that the ages less than 20 got the highest count of the insurance cover

# Barplots
## A barplot of the smoker/Non-Smoker vs chargers

### The barplot indictaed the the smokers had a higher charges mean compared to the non-smokers

# Boxplots
## A boxplot of the smoker/Non-Smoker vs Charges

###  The boxplot above shows the 25th , 50th and 75th percentiles of the insurance data , and the mean of the smoker and non-smoker group.

# CountPlots
##  A count plot of individuals by region

 ### From the countplot, we see that the southeast has the highest counts of individuals under the insurance

# Heatmaps
## A heat of the correlations

### From the heatmap above we see a strong positive correlation between the smoker and charges, if an individual is a smoker the charges are higher
